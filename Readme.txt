WHAT IS IN THIS FOLDER
__________________________

The rhino 5 file included are the design and manufacturing files for the Matte III.II open source guitar.
Included are:

- An assembled model used for an understanding of how the guitar fits together. This model contains closed and open polysurfaces and is not to be used for manufacturing.

- CNC routing  vectors. These are ready to be put through CAM softwares but do not include depth of cut. Refer to the included GA's for this information.

- laser cutting vectors. These are used to manufacture the rails, frame, top, bottom and sides of the guitar. 


ALL VECTORS ARE OFFSET FOR MECHANICAL BUT NOT MANUFACTURING TOLERENCES. 
This means depending on what material, and manufacturing process you use, you will need to offset the vectors to size.



Also included is General Assembly drawings in PDF format. This can be used as reference through manufacturing processes.
It also includes information about material selection and desired properties of parts.

RED LINES
_________________________

Red lines indicate component specific vectors or shapes. These are specific to the parts I have used for my model and can be used as reference.
DO NOT MANUFACTURE THESE FILES WITHOUT ADJUSTING THE RED LINES TO YOUR SPECIFIC PARTS. 
- The neck slot should fit a typical bolt on neck with a mechanical tolerence of 0.2mm.
- The pickup slots are determined by the shape of your pickups and position is determined by the sound you want. More information here: http://buildyourguitar.com/resources/lospennato/index.htm
- The bridge and tailpeice holes are defined by your neck's scale length as well as the bridge parts you are using. You can find more information here: http://www.stewmac.com/How-To/Online_Resources/Fretting/Scale_Length_Explained.html
